This is a cross platform driver and viewer application for the Swimovate
Poolmate Pro swimming watch.

The poolmate dongle is actually a TI3410 USB-serial interface.
There is already a kernel driver for the TI3410 - ti_usb_3410_5052 which could
probably be used instead. However trying to get it working just resulted in
failure to download firmware errors, despite pointing it at the right firmware
from the windows driver. Also the linux driver doesn't seem to detect when
there are two configurations (i.e. the firmware is already loaded) and just
select the second without attempting to download.

Therefore.... for now will stick to the simplistic included userspace USB
driver instead although now changed to just dump down the raw data so might
add an option to download from a ttyUSB device instead just incase I get the
serial driver working.

The data protocol is pretty straightforward, the watch just serially dumps a
binary representation of its contents when it's placed onto the dock.
